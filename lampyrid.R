#finally, let's do some generalized linear modelling to see what's important and if we can explain what's going on
#we've clearly got a quadratic resonse to degree day accumulation, and since we're dealing with count data, we should model 
#it using a poisson structure (or negative binomial if we've got a high residual deviance)
#we'll use the MASS package

#After some initial fiddling, we find out that rain.days is a better predictor than precipitation accumulation, and given that these are 
#seriously autocorrelated, let's just use rain days
#we know TREAT_DESC is probably not important in interacting with dd.acc as we did not observe major tends by treatment when we looked at 
#trends in captures by degree day accumulation by  treatment so we won't look for interactions
#finally, because of convergence problems using glm.nb, we determined theta (dispersion parameter) iteratively
#using glm with a negative binomial family instead. Less elegant and more labour intensive- but really brought residual deviance and AIC
#values down, indicating a much better fit
